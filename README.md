# USZ Parser

Program for parsing the excel file that was created by Bertrand Pouymayou 
and then filled with patients by Jean-Marc Hoffmann. The excel file's 
particular structure makes it necessary to hard-code the location of all 
information. It is stored in the accompanying JSON file.

In its current state, the following info is extracted from the Excel file and 
grouped according to what I thought could fit:

## Table structure

The header of the CSV file has three rows. This is to group columns into categories 
and subcategories. In the list below the overarching categories are the first 
list level, then comes a finer categorization and finally the name and description 
of the actual row.

1. **``patient``** This contains all info that is patient-specific
   1.  **``general``** Info not necessarily related to his disease
       1.  **``ID``** (``int``) Random ID number.
       2.  **``gender``** (``male`` or ``female``) Gender of the patient.
       3.  **``age``** (``int``) Age at diagnosis.
       4.  **``diagnosedate``** (``date``) Date of diagnosis.

   3.  **``condition``** More info about patient's health condition.
       1.  **``HPV``** (``bool``) p16 status.

   4.  **``stage``** N & M part of the TNM staging system. T is not reported here, since it is tumor-specific
       1.  **``N``** (``int``) Stage of nodal involvement.
       2.  **``M``** (``int``) Stage of distant metastases.


2.  **``tumor``** Collects info about primary tumor(s).
    1.  **``1``** Info about first primary tumor.
        1.  **``location``** (``str``) Location of the tumor.
        2.  **``subsite``** (``str``) Subsite, essentially more precise report of tumor location.
        3.  **``ICD-O-3``** (``str``) ICD code of the tumor subsite.
        4.  **``side``** (``left``, ``right`` or ``central``) Lateralization of primary tumor
        5.  **``extension``** (``bool``) Tumor extends over sagittal midline or not
        6.  **``size``** (``float``) Size of tumor in cmÂ³.
        7.  **``prefix``** (``c`` or ``p``) Prefix for tumor T-stage.
        8.  **``stage``** (``int``) T-stage of tumor.
    
    2. **``2``** Info about second tumor (if it exists) ...
       1. ...


3. **``{modality 1}``** Report of nodal involvement for ``{modality 1}``.
   1. **``info``** Quick info about the diagnosis.
      1. **``date``** (``date``) Date when diagnosis was taken.
   
   2. **``right``** Diagnosed involvement of the right side of the neck.
      1. **``I``** (``bool``) Involvement of LNL I
      2. **``II``** (``bool``) Involvement of LNL II
      3. **``III``** (``bool``) Involvement of LNL III
      4. ...
   
   3. **``left``** Diagnosed involvement of the left side of the neck.
      1. **``I``** (``bool``) Involvement of LNL I
